I was excited to read the job posting on the district website for a paraprofessional to work with children who are deaf and hard of hearing.
Like many students who are deaf and hard of hearing, they had language delays.
After the pair moved on to middle school, I was transferred to Hopewell, where I currently assist a classroom teacher for the deaf and hard of hearing.
Most of my work is with children in grades 2-5, so I have a lot of experience in the age range desired for this paraprofessional job.
