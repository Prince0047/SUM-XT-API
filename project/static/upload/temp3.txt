I was excited to read the job posting on the district website for a paraprofessional to work with children who are deaf and hard of hearing. I have a lot of valuable expertise in this field and admire the strides that Carson Elementary has made in education.I have the required paraprofessional licensure, and I am fluent in both ASL and SEE. I have worked at Jamison Elementary and Hopewell Elementary for the past five years; the schools are in the Salem School District. I started at Jamison, where I supported the educational and social learning of a pair of 8-year-olds who have cochlear implants and who were mostly mainstreamed. I adapted lesson plans from the general education teacher to better fit the studentsâ€™ language levels. Like many students who are deaf and hard of hearing, they had language delays. After the pair moved on to middle school, I was transferred to Hopewell, where I currently assist a classroom teacher for the deaf and hard of hearing. I reinforce her teaching, for example, by holding intensive one-on-one or small-group tutoring sessions in subjects such as math, reading, and writing. Most of my work is with children in grades 2-5, so I have a lot of experience in the age range desired for this paraprofessional job. Teachers in all grades frequently commend me for my work with students, and I am an excellent communicator who has a knack for working with children.I look forward to seeing where this opportunity can go. I hope we can speak soon, and I appreciate you taking the time to review my application.
